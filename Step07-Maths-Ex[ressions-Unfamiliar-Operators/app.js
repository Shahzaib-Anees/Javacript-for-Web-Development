// Maths Expressions Unfamiliar Operators 

// JavaScript Use some Unfamiliar Operators other than Addition , Substraction , Multiplication , Division and Modulus.

// These opertors makes the work easy and shorthen the length of code just like Incriment , Decriment Operators.
// But we are unable to do addition and substraction of the value larger than 1 .
// We are also to do Multiplication , Modulus and Division.

// Operators to direct add,subtract,multiply,divide and moduluo  bigger values:-

// We can direct add,subtract,multiply,divide and moduluo bigger values in the number(existing variable) by using following Operators.

var num = 2;

// For Direct Addition of 8 in above declared variable 

num += 8;

// For Direct Substraction of 8 in above declared variable 

num -= 8;

// For Direct multiplication of 8 in above declared variable 

num += 8;

// For Direct Division of 8 in above declared variable 

num /= 8;

// For Direct Modulus by 8 in above declared variable 

num %= 8;
