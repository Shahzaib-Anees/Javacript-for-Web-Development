// Incriment and Decriment Operators :- 

// JavaScript uses some Unfamiliar for Adding and Substracting numbers from the present state which are known as "Incriment and Decriment Operators" .
// These Operators have a real significance in realtime Programming.

// Incriment Operators :- 
    //  The word Incriment means "To Incease or Add" .Similarly, In JavaScript Incrimnet is used to add a single(1) value in the existing number(variable);

    var num = 3

    num++ //Incriment Operator

    // Types of Incriment :-

    // There are two Incriments done by using Incriment Operator
    1- Pre-Incriment 
    2- Post-Incriment

    // 1-Pre-Incriment :- 

    // Pre incriment adds the value on the same line.
    
    ++num // Pre-Incriment 
    
    // 2- Post-Incriment:-
    
    // Pre incriment adds the value on the next line.
    num ++ //Post-Incriment

// Decriment Operators :- 
    //  The word Decriment means "To Decease or Substract" .Similarly, In JavaScript Decriment Operator is used to substract a single(1) value in the existing number(variable);
    var num1 = 5
    // If I want to substract 1 in above variable ,I can simply use Decriment operator.
    num1-- //Decriment Operator


    // Types of Decriment :-

    // There are two Decriments done by using Incriment Operator
    1- Pre-Decriment 
    2- Post-Decriment

    // 1-Pre-Decriment :- 

    // Pre Decriment substracts the value on the same line.
    
    --num1 // Pre-Decriment 
    
    // 2- Post-Decriment:-
    
    // Pre Decriment substracts the value on the next line.
    num1 -- //Post-Decriment
