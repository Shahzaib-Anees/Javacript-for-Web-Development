 Diffference Between Programming Language and Scrippting Language :-
          During our starting journey of Coding,we all have one Question in Common which is the "WHat is the Difference between Programming language and Scripting Language"?
        
         So the Answer of above Question is very Simple  ;
      "A Programming Language's code is compiled and can be excecutable to the file " means we can create an Object/file after the execution of Programming Language.

     Whereas ; 
      "A Scripting Language's code is transpiled and cannot be excutable to the file " means we cannot create an Object/Filr after the execution of Scripting Language such that it can only be use to define other files functionality (like via HTML5 in Webpages)
