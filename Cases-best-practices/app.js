// These cases are introduced to enhance readability of Long Chained Variable Names .

// 1-Camel Case

            // Camel Case Idea was introduced by some developers for enhencing the readability of Code .
            // This is one of the best practices for declaring Variables and Functions names.
            // In Camel , the first Letter of every new word in the sequence will be capital and the other letters will be small.
            
            // For Example :-

             // In Snake Case , an UnderScore ( _ ) adds after the end of every word in the sequence.         
             
             // For Example :- 
             var guy_who_keep_repeating_his_name = "Shahzaib";
